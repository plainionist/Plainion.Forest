# Plainion.Forest

Plainion.Forest is a simple, pragmatic and personal "backlog" tool. While many good issue tracking and 
collaboration tools are out there those are usually overkill when it comes to one-man projects and 
personal TODOs tracking.

This is where Plainion.Forest jumps in. It allows you to structure your TODOs (or backlog items) in a 
simple ordered tree structure. You can nest it as deeply as you like. A dedicated tree ("Planning") supports
focusing on the next steps
